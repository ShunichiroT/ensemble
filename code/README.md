There are seven scripts implementing six individual genomic prediction models and the naïve ensemble-average model:

1. Implement the classical and ML genomic prediction models. The implementation order does not affect the result
     - Change the file path to yours

2. Combine all the predicted phenotypes of RILs for your test set stored in the output folder to create a predicted phenotype matrix
     - The format is specified in the README file at the Data folder

4. Use the predicted phenotype matrix as the input for the naïve ensemble-average
