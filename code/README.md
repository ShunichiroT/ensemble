# Code

This folder contains the six individual genotype-phenotype (G2P) and one ensemble model.

1)	Run the six G2P models and store predicted phenotypes from each model. The order of implementation does not affect the subsequent process
2)	Create a predicted phenotype matrix (n x m+1). Each row should represent each line and the first six columns (m) are the predicted phenotypes from each individual G2P model. The last column is the observed phenotype
3)	Run the ensemble model by using a file storing the matrix developed in the previous step
