# Code

This folder contains the six individual genomic prediction and one ensemble model.

1)	Run the six genomic prediction models and store predicted phenotypes from each model. The order of implementation does not affect the subsequent process.
2)	Create a predicted phenotype matrix (n x m+2). Each row should represent each RIL (total is n). The first column indicates ids, the next six columns (m) are the predicted phenotypes from each individual genomic prediction model and the last column is the observed phenotype.
3)	Run the ensemble model using the matrix developed in the previous step.
