The shared code is used for "Improvements in Prediction Performance of Ensemble Approaches for Genomic Prediction in Crop Breeding"

Workflow:
1) Your target data should be preprocessed first. Imputation and pruning were applied to this experiment
2) Each individual genotype-phenotype model should return their genomic prediction result, which is used as input for an ensemble
